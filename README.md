# cypress test page

This project provides a very basic website which can be automatically tested by cypress. The website is plain HTML and vanilla Javascript. There is no need for any frameworks.

## Getting started

### Running the website

To view the website you can use xampp or any other tool of your choice that is able to serve `HTML` files. I am using a simple python HTTP-Server:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
